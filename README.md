# PRODIGY_CS_01: Caesar Cipher Implementation
This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting characters according to a given shift value.

## How to Use
You can use this program in two modes: via command-line arguments or interactively.

### Command-Line Mode
To encrypt a message, run the following command:
```bash
python PRODIGY_CS01.py -t "Your message here" -s 3 -m encrypt
```
To decrypt a message, run the following command:
```bash
python PRODIGY_CS01.py -t "Encrypted message here" -s 3 -m decrypt
```

#### Interactive Mode
If no arguments are provided, the program will switch to interactive mode where you can enter the message and shift value during execution.
